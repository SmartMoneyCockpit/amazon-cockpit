# PPC & SEO Pages â€” What they do

## PPC Import Wizard
Upload a CSV exported from Amazon Ads (or a Google Sheet). The page parses your data to show core KPIs
(Impressions, Clicks, Spend, ACoS, ROAS, Orders) and suggests negative keywords. This works **without** the Ads API.

## A+ & SEO Indexing Checker
Upload a CSV of target keywords with columns:
`keyword, priority(High/Med/Low), est_search_volume, indexed(TRUE/FALSE or blank)`.
The page calculates keyword coverage and flags gaps so you can fix indexing.

## A+ & SEO Panel
Two-part panel tied to Google Sheets (CSV fallback):
- **Keyword Indexing**: same idea as the Indexing Checker but live from a Sheet.
- **Competitor Snapshot**: upload/sync competitors with columns like
  `asin,title,brand,price,reviews,stars,weight_kg,size,restricted_notes` for side-by-side comparisons.
